# Data-Structures

## What is it?
These are my implementations of popular data structures in C++. They are not meant to be performant.
Each data structures in independent of others, so you would only need the C/C++ stl to run them out the box.

## What is the purpose of these?
This is just a demonstration of how to implement some of these data structures. These are not meant to be used in any project.
At most they should be used as a reference on how an actual implementation might work, and that's why they're so simple.

## What's implemented?
- Entity-Component framework
